#    This file contains miscellaneous implementation notes and thoughts for 
# future additions/improvements to the Makefile subsystem.

Add (automatic?) dependencies btwn (relative?) directories in include path
   recursive MAKE to check whether or not to rebuild that target
   NOTE: Must link each and every time to ensure DBG/OPT mode changes are 
   updated

Automatic detection of all C,cpp,cc,c etc and H,h

----------------------------


Define MAX/MIN function on arithmetic? is it even worth it?

Investigate linux source build system for inspiration

Add Unittests for all new boolean logic variables

Test PROFILE= on commandline


OLD:
   * Add multidirectory support
        By default, icompile-like, directory descending 
        automatic incorporation of directories
   * Investigate MAPping $(MAKE) -C dir over all directories :)
   * Ensure BFS does not produce duplicate entries
   * For SPEED/EFFICIENCY, have a generic way to $(or $(eval etwas := $1),$(etwas)) 
        when $(etwas) will be used multiple times
   * Add ALL MODE which compiles DBG and OPT targets
   * Add support for creating archives/shared objects
   * Must have MODE-specific dependency files
   * Check out -MMD and -MT/-MQ flags for gcc
        Only compile once! --> generate dependency information during normal compilation
